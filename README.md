#  Decision Tree Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** trained on the classic **Iris dataset** using scikit-learn.  
The model achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of decision trees for simple, well-structured datasets.

## Results
- **Accuracy:** 100%  
- **Dataset:** Iris (150 samples, 3 classes)  
- **Test ratio:** 0.2 (80% training, 20% testing)  

---

##  Key Features
- ✅ Used **train_test_split** from scikit-learn to divide data into training and testing sets.  
- ✅ Implemented **cross-validation** to evaluate model performance.  
- ✅ Computed and displayed the **confusion matrix**.  
- ✅ Visualized the **Decision Tree structure** using scikit-learn’s `plot_tree`.  
- ✅ Clean and modular code inside a Jupyter Notebook.
